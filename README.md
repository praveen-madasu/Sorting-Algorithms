# Sorting-Algorithms
4 Sorting Algorithms implemented using C++ programming language
1) Insertion Sort
2) Merge Sort
3) In-Place Quick Sort
4) Modified Quick Sort (Median of Three)

Implemented these 4 algorithms and tested with an input sizes of 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 30000, 40000, 50000.
Input array is generated using uniform distribution random number generator.

Plotted graphs for the recorded execution times of all algorithms for different input sizes.
Analyzed performance for sorted & reverse sorted order with all input sizes for all algorithms.
